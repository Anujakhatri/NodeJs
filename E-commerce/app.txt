 Description about app.Js
1.what does cookie-parser do?
 - Cookie-parser is a middleware for Express that parses cookies attached to the client request object.
   It makes cookies available as a JavaScript object via req.cookies, so you can easily read and use cookie values in your routes and middleware.

2. app.use
-app.use(Add middleware) adds middleware to your Express app.
 Middleware runs for every request (unless a path is specified).

-app.set(set config) is used to configure settings for your Express app, such as the view engine or custom variables.

-app.get(Handles GET requests) is used to define a route handler for HTTP GET requests.
  for example 
    app.get("/", function(req, res) {
        res.send("Hello World");
    });


3. What happening here? 
  app.use("/owners", ownersRouter); 
  app.use("/users",usersRouter);

- app.use(path, router) → mounts a router object at a specific base path.
- those routers (ownersRouter, usersRouter) are usually directly related to models like Owner and User in your MongoDB via Mongoose.

4. What a Debugger Does?
  A debugger gives you tools to inspect your program while it runs:

 -Breakpoints – Pause your code at a specific line so you can see what’s happening.
 -Step Execution – Run your code line by line to see exactly where it breaks.
 -Variable Inspection – Check the values of variables at any point.
 -Call Stack – See the chain of function calls that led to the current point.
 -Watch Expressions – Monitor specific variables or calculations as the code runs.


5. What Environment Variables Are?
  -They are like placeholders for values your app needs, e.g., API URLs, database credentials, secret keys.
   -Instead of hardcoding these values into your code, you store them in environment variables.
      for examples:
        // Instead of this (hardcoded)
        const DB_URL = "mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb";

        // Use environment variable
        const DB_URL = process.env.DB_URL;

  Q.Why We Need Them?
   Environment variables make your app secure, flexible, and easier to manage, especially when working with multiple environments(developement, testing , production) or sensitive data.

6. What config does?

 -Holds environment-specific settings: development, testing, production.
 -Keeps sensitive info out of the main code (like database passwords, API keys).
 -Makes it easy to change values without editing the code.
